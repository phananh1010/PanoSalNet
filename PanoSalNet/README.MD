Code for building model from scratch is on progress. This code needs model weights from Deep Convnet [site]( https://github.com/imatge-upc/saliency-2016-cvpr) to continue transfer learning.
If you want to use our model directly, download our model weights  [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/aizk2ku56xjd22u/AAD0NJ4J5jeSWM1wJxZAYbLda?dl=0), and put in ./states folder.
